# Classifying Mushroom Edibility
#### Fall 2022 Erdos Bootcamp Final Project
#### Team Members: Dylan Cordaro, Schinella D'Souza, Teresa Yu

The goal of our project is to be able to predict the edibility of gilled mushrooms, and to provide useful tools for mushroom hunters and foragers. We used the Mushroom Classification dataset from the UCI Machine Learning repository via Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).

Our final model was a decision tree model, and it has a test accuracy of ~99%. It also provides a simple algorithm, utilizing only the odor and spore print color of a mushroom sample, to help mushroom foragers determine edibility. However, we still recommend consulting a field guide or expert whenever unsure about the edibility of a sample.
